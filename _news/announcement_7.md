Excited to share that I'll be visiting Polytechnique Montréal to work with Prof. Foutse Khomh. This short-term research will focus on using formal methods for AI safety. I'll be in Montréal until Aug 28, 2025. If you're in the area and want to chat about research, AI safety, or anything else, feel free to reach out!
