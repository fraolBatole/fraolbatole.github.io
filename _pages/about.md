I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Tulane University, where I recently transitioned with my advisor [Prof. Hridesh Rajan](https://hridesh.github.io/). Prior to joining Tulane, I completed my Master's degree at Iowa State University (ISU) and undertook graduate-level coursework at the University of North Dakota (UND). My academic journey began at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, where I earned my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering, graduating Magna cum laude.

## Research

My research lies at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on enhancing deep learning models and large language models (LLMs) through novel software engineering methodologies. My current research objectives include:

- **Program Analysis for LLMs**: I am exploring LLM‑based agentic systems that bridge program analysis and natural‑language reasoning to automate complex software engineering tasks.

- **AI System Reliability**: Investigating and improving the reliability of AI systems through empirical studies and automated analysis techniques. I also work on verifying and validating agents’ actions to ensure reliability and correctness in real‑world development workflows.

I am privileged to actively collaborate with distinguished researchers in the field, including [Prof. Tien N. Nguyen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/), [Prof. Danny Dig](https://danny.cs.colorado.edu/), and [Prof. Foutse Khomh](https://www.khomh.net/), whose expertise has significantly enriched my research perspective. My earlier work contributed to [Boag](https://boalang.org/boag/index.php), a shared data science infrastructure for bioinformatics.
