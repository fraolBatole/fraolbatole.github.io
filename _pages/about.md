I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the computer science program at Iowa State University (ISU) and working as a research assistant at the Laboratory for Software Design under the supervision of [Prof. Hridesh Rajan](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/hridesh). Before joining ISU, I completed a year of graduate-level courses at the University of North Dakota (UND). I earned my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, where I graduated Magna cum laude.

Research
------
My primary research interests revolve around the application of software engineering and program analysis concepts to enhance deep learning models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, my current work focuses on exploring static analysis methodologies to achieve two main objectives: i) mitigating bugs in deep learning models and ii) improving the performance of LLMs for source code representation. Prior to this, I gained experience working on a shared data science infrastructure for bioinformatics known as [Boag](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/boag/index.php).
